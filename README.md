# Sensor Simulation Framework

The framework can be used to define sensor simulations following mathematical laws.

The whole project is composed of the following parts :
- **framework**, defines the generic classes used to create simulations;
- **stdlib**, defines a few usual transformation laws that can be used to create simulations ;
- **smartcampus**, uses the framework and stdlib in the smartcampus context ;
- **service**, exposes services allowing the on-demand launch of some specific simulations ;
